1) importan lesson learned from Akamai - some maven depencencies are created with
      <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
      <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
      <version>3.7.1</version>
      and some require
      <type>pom</type>
        usually those are the onces who redirect or use other poms
